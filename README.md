Hi there.

I was working through Alex Garrett-Smith older Codecourse course on building a simple container and autowiring.
https://codecourse.com/courses/learn-how-autowiring-works<br><br>
Unfortunately, mention in the lecture is made about an available repo, but this was not available.

This is such a great course.<br>
The course leverages up skills and Alex explains the container and autowiring process very well, in my opinion.<br>
I know I will need to go through it a number of times to pin down and more fully understand the process Alex explains.<br>
I went through the course in detail and here is the final code for my own use, and also yours, if interested.<br><br>
Note:  All commented sections were mentioned in the lecture as he moved through and discarded each.<br>
Note:  I also built my own exception handler to catch exceptions as a template view in the templates folder.<br>
Note:  I use the classic composer dump to add classes to the vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php<br>
I also use composer start to run the code.<br>
I.e. both of these are set up in composer.json scripts.<br>
Note:  I left the vendor folder and .idea in the folder and did not gitignore them as I will be downloading and using the folder as is when I revisit this course again soon.

Enjoy.
